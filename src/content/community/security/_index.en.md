Submariner welcomes and appreciates responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

If you know of a security issue with Submariner, please report it to submariner-security@googlegroups.com.

Submariner aspires to follow the [Kubernetes security reporting process](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/),
but is far too small of a project to implement those practices. Where applicable, Submariner will follow the principles of the Kubernetes
process.
