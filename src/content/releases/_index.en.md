## v0.3.0 Lighthouse Service Discovery without KubeFed

> This release is focused on removing the KubeFed dependency from Lighthouse, improving the user experience
> and adding experimental WireGuard support as an alternative to IPsec

* Lighthouse no longer depends KubeFed. All metadata exchange is handled over the Broker as MultiClusterService CRs.
* Experimental **Wireguard** support has been added as a pluggable CableDriver option in addition to the current default IPsec.
* Submariner reports the active and passive gateways as a gateway.submariner.io CRD.
* The Submariner Operator reports a detailed status of the deployment.
* The **gateway redundancy/failover** tests are now enabled and stable in CI.
* *Globalnet hostNetwork* to remote globalIP is now supported. Previously, when a pod used hostNetworking it was unable to connect to a remote service via globalIP.
* A globalCIDR can be manually specified when joining a cluster with globalnet enabled. This enables CI speed optimizations via better parallelism.
* Operator and subctl are more robust via standard retries on updates.
* Subctl creates a new **individual access token** for every new joined cluster.


## v0.2.0 Overlapping CIDR support

> This release is focused on overlapping CIDR support between clusters

* Support for Overlapping CIDRs between clusters (globalnet)
* Enhanced e2e scripts, which will be shared between repositories in the shipyard project (ongoing work)
* Improved e2e deployment by using a local registry.
* Refactoring to support pluggable drivers (in preparation for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) support)


## v0.1.1 Submariner with more light

> This release has focused on stability for the Lighthouse support

* Cleaner logging for the submariner-engine
* Cleaner logging for the submariner-route-agent
* Fixed issue with wrong token stored in subm file #244
* Added flag to disable the OpenShift CVO #235
* Fixed several service-discovery related bugs #194 , #167
* Fixed several panics on nil network discovery
* Added checks to ensure the CIDRs for joining cluster don't overlap with an existing ones.
* Fix context handling related to service-discovery / kubefed #180
* Use the right CoreDNS image for OpenShift.

## v0.1.0 Submariner with some light

> This release has focused on stability, bugfixes and making https://github.com/submariner.io/lighthouse available as developer preview via subctl deployments.

* Several bugfixes and enhancements around HA failover (#346, #348, #332)
* Migrated to Daemonsets for submariner gateway deployment
* Added support for hostNetwork to remote pod/service connectivity (#288)
* Auto detection and configuration of MTU for vx-submariner, jumbo frames support (#301)
* Support for updated strongswan (#288)
* Better iptables detection for some hosts (#227)

> subctl and the submariner operator have the following improvements

* support to verify-connectivity between two connected clusters
* deployment of submariner gateways based in daemonsets instead of deployments
* renaming submariner pods to "submariner-gateway" pods for clarity
* print version details on crash (subctl)
* stop storing IPSEC key on broker during deploy-broker, now it's only contained into the .subm file
* version command for subctl
* nicer spinners during deployment (thanks to kind)


## v0.0.3 -- KubeCon NA 2019

>Submariner has been greatly enhanced to allow operators to deploy into Kubernetes clusters without the necessity for layer-2 adjacency for nodes. Submariner now allows for VXLAN interconnectivity between nodes (facilitated by the route agent). Subctl
was created to make deployment of submariner easier.
