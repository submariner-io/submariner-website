## Overview

You have followed steps in [Deployment](../deployment) but something has gone wrong. You're not sure what and how to fix it, or what
information to collect to raise an issue. Welcome to the Submariner troubleshooting guide where we will help you get your deployment working
again.

Basic familiarity with the Submariner components and architecture will be helpful when troubleshooting so please review the
[Architecture](../architecture) section.

The guide has been broken into different sections for easy navigation.

### Pre-requisite

Before we begin troubleshooting, run `subctl version` to obtain which version of the Submariner components you are running.

Run `kubectl get services -n <service-namespace> | grep <service-name>` to get information about the service you're trying to access. This
will provide you with the Service *Name*, *Namespace* and *ServiceIP*. If **GlobalNet** is enabled, you will also need the *globalIp* of the
service by running

`kubectl get service <service-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.submariner\.io/globalIp}'`

### Deployment Issues

This section will contain information about common deployment issues you can run into.

#### TBD

### Connectivity Issues

Submariner deployment completed successfully but Services/Pods on one cluster are unable to connect to Services on another cluster. This can
be due to multiple factors outlined in the following sections.

#### IPSec tunnel not created between clusters

TBD

#### IPSEc tunnel is not up between clusters

TBD

#### None of pods/services able to connect to remote service

TBD

##### Without GlobalNet

TBD

##### With GlobalNet

TBD

#### Pods on non-gateway nodes not able to connect to remote service

TBD

##### Without GlobalNet

TBD

##### With GlobalNet

TBD

-->

### Service Discovery Issues

If you are able to connect to remote service by using ServiceIP or globalIp, but not by service name, it is a Service Discovery Issue.

#### Service Discovery not working

This is good time to familiarize yourself with [Service Discovery Architecture](../architecture/service-discovery/) if you haven't already.

##### Check ServiceExport for your Service

For a Service to be accessible across clusters, you must first export the Service via `subctl` which creates a `ServiceExport` resource.
Ensure the `ServiceExport` resource exists and check if its status condition indicates `Exported'. Otherwise, its status condition will
indicate the reason it wasn't exported.

`kubectl get serviceexport -n <service-namespace> <service-name>`

Sample output:

```yaml
apiVersion: lighthouse.submariner.io/v2alpha1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: nginx
Status:
  Conditions:
    Message:  Service was successfully synced to the broker
    Status:   True
    Type:     Exported
```

##### Check Lighthouse CoreDNS Service

All cross-cluster service queries are handled by Lighthouse CoreDNS server. First we check if the Lighthouse CoreDNS Service is running
properly.

`kubectl -n submariner-operator get service submariner-lighthouse-coredns`

If it is running fine, note down the `ServiceIP` for the next steps. If not, check the logs for an error.

If the error is due to a wrong image, run `kubectl -n submariner-operator get deployment submariner-lighthouse-coredns` and make sure
`Image` is set to `quay.io/submariner/lighthouse-coredns:<version>` and refers to the correct version.

For any other errors, capture the information and raise a new [issue](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues)

If there's no error, then check if the Lighthouse CoreDNS server is configured correctly. Run `kubectl describe configmap
submariner-lighthouse-coredns` and make sure it has following configuration:

```text
    supercluster.local:53 {
        lighthouse
        errors
        health
        ready
    }
```

##### Check CoreDNS Configuration

Submariner requires the CoreDNS deployment to forward requests for the domain `supercluster.local` to the Lighthouse CoreDNS server in the
cluster making the query. Ensure this configuration exists and is correct.

First we check if CoreDNS is configured to forward requests for domain `supercluster.local` to Lighthouse CoreDNS Server in the cluster
making the query.

`kubectl describe configmap coredns`

In the output look for something like this:

```text
    supercluster.local:53 {
        forward . <lighthouse-coredns-serviceip> ======> ServiceIP of lighthouse-coredns service as noted in previous section
    }
```

If the entries highlighted above are missing or `ServiceIp` is incorrect, it means CoreDNS wasn't configured correctly. It can be fixed by
running `kubectl edit configmap coredns` and making the changes manually. You may need to repeat this step on every cluster.

##### Check submariner-lighthouse-agent

Next we check if the `submariner-lighthouse-agent` is properly running. Run `kubectl -n submariner-operator get pods
submariner-lighthouse-agent` and check the status of Pods.

If the status indicates the `ImagePullBackOff` error, run `kubectl -n submariner-operator describe deployment submariner-lighthouse-agent`
and check if `Image` is set correctly to `quay.io/submariner/lighthouse-agent:<version>`. If it is and the same error still occurs, raise an
issue [here](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues) or ping us on the community slack channel.

If the status indicates any other error, run `kubectl -n submariner-operator get pods` to get the name of the `lighthouse-agent` Pod. Then
run `kubectl -n submariner-operator logs <lighthouse-agent-pod-name>` to get the logs. See if there are any errors in the log. If yes, raise
an [issue](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues) with the log contents, or you can continue reading through this guide to
troubleshoot further.

If there are no errors, grep the log for the service name that you're trying to query as we may need the log entries later for raising an
issue.

##### Check ServiceImport resources

If the steps above did not indicate an issue, next we check if the ServiceImport resources were properly created for the service you're
trying to access. The format of a ServiceImport resources's name is as follows:

`<service-name>-<service-namespace>-<cluster-id>`

Run `kubectl get serviceimports --all-namespaces |grep <your-service-name>` on the broker cluster to check if a resource was created for
your service. If not, then check the Lighthouse Agent logs on the cluster where service was created and look for any error or warning
messages indicating a failure to create the ServiceImport resource for your service. The most common error is `Forbidden` if the RBAC wasn't
configured correctly. Depending on the deployment method used, 'subctl' or 'helm', it should've been done for you. Create an
[issue](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues) with relevant log entries.

If the ServiceImport resource was created correctly on the broker cluster, the next step is to check if it exists on the cluster where
you're trying to access the service. Follow the same steps as earlier to get the list of the ServiceImport resources and check if the
ServiceImport for your service exists. If not, check the logs of the Lighthouse Agent on the cluster where you are trying to access the
service. As described earlier, it will most commonly be an issue with RBAC otherwise create an
[issue](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues) with relevant log entries.

If the ServiceImport resource was created properly on the cluster, run
`kubectl -n submariner-operator describe serviceimport <your-serviceimport-name>`
and check if it has the correct `ClusterID` and `ServiceIP`:

```text
Name:         nginx-default-cluster2

Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  origin-name: nginx

  Clusters:
    Cluster:  cluster2 ==========> ClusterID of cluster where service is running
    Ips:
      100.92.43.63     ==========> ServiceIP or GlobalIP of service you're trying to access
Events:  <none>
```

Note that for a headless Service, the `Ips` field will contain the list of associated Endpoint IPs.

If the data is not correct, you can manually edit the ServiceImport resource to set the correct IP as a workaround and create an
[issue](https://github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse/issues) with relevant information.

If the ServiceImport `Ips` are correct but still not being returned from DNS queries, check the connectivity to the cluster
using [`subctl show endpoint`](../deployment/subctl/_index.en.md#show-endpoints). The Lighthouse CoreDNS Server only returns IPs
from connected clusters.
