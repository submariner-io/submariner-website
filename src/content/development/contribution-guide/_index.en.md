#### Release Candidates

At the end of 12 weeks, the project is ready to be released and the pre-release `rc0` is created.
At this point, as detailed in the [release process] documentation, stable branches are created and the project goes into feature freeze
for the release branches.

Two [test days](#test-days) will take place after the release is created, as the project members make sure the release is ready for
[general availability](#general-availability).
Any bugs found during the test days will need to be labeled with the appropriate `testday` label.
The project members will triage the test day bugs and identify any high priority ones that should be addressed before general availability.

If any high priority bugs were identified after `rc0`, a new release `rc1` will be planned to allow for fixing them.
The `rc1` release will be planned at the team's discretion and has no expected date.
If no `rc1` release is planned, the team will proceed with the general availability release.

Starting from `rc1`, the stable branches enter a code freeze mode - only blocker bugs will be eligible for merging.
If a bug is fixed and merged during the code freeze, a new release candidate needs to be prepared and tested.
Releasing `rc2` and beyond will delay the general availability release.
