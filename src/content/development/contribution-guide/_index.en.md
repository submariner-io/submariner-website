### Sprints

Sprints are 3 week periods which encapsulate work on the release.
Most sprints focus on active development of the current version, while some focus on additional aspects such as design and stabilization.
Specific sprints and their contents are details in the following sections.

Each sprint starts and ends on a boundry day, when one sprint ends another one begins.
The boundry day is **Monday**.

On the sprint boundry day we will:

* Perform a milestone release (When applicable).
* Have release related meetings, instead of any usually recurring meetings:
  * Grooming (30 minutes):
    * Making sure epics are on track.
    * Reviewing the Definition of Done for each epic.
    * Moving epics back to the Backlog, in case they're de-prioritized.
  * Retrospective (30 minutes):
    * Looking back at the task sizes and assessing if they were correct.
    * General process improvement.
  * Demos (30 minutes):
    * Any enhancements (or parts of) that have been delivered in the sprint.
    * Other interesting changes (e.g. refactors) that aren't part of any epic.
    * In case there's nothing to showcase, this meeting will be skipped.
