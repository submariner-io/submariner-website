## Release Cycles

The Submariner project follows time based release cycles where each cycle is 16 weeks long.
While blocking bugs may delay the [general availability](#general-availability) release date, new features will not.

Features that were partially implemented in a given release will be considered "experimental" and won't have any support commitment.

Each cycle will result in either a minor version bump or a major version bump in case backwards compatibility can't be maintained.
