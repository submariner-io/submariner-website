### Sprints

Sprints are 3 week periods which encapsulate work on the release.
Most sprints focus on active development of the current version, while some focus on additional aspects such as design and stabilization.
Specific sprints and their contents are detailed in the following sections.

Most sprints will end with a milestone pre-release, the designation of which is detailed in the following sections.
This allows the community and project members to verify the project is stable and test any fixes or features that were added during the
sprint.
For most sprints a [test day](#test-days) to test the pre-release will be held after its creation.

Each sprint starts and ends on a boundary day, when one sprint ends another one begins.
The boundary day is **Monday**.

On the sprint boundary day we will:

* Perform a milestone pre-release (when applicable).
* Have release related meetings, instead of any usually recurring meetings:
  * Grooming (30 minutes):
    * Making sure epics are on track.
    * Reviewing the Definition of Done for each epic.
    * Moving epics back to the Backlog, in case they're de-prioritized.
  * Retrospective (30 minutes):
    * Looking back at the task sizes and assessing if they were correct.
    * General process improvement.
  * Demos (30 minutes):
    * Any enhancements (or parts of) that have been delivered in the sprint.
    * Other interesting changes (e.g. refactors) that aren't part of any epic.
    * In case there's nothing to showcase, this meeting will be skipped.
