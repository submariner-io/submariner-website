### Sprints

Sprints are 3 week periods which encapsulate work on the release.
Most sprints focus on active development of the current version, while some focus on additional aspects such as design and stabilization.
Specific sprints and their contents are detailed in the following sections.

Most sprints will end with a milestone pre-release as detailed in the following sections.
This allows the community and project members to verify the project is stable and test any fixes or features that were added during the
sprint.
A formal [test day](#test-days) may be held to facilitate testing of the pre-release.

Each sprint ends on a boundary day which also marks the beginning of the next sprint.
The boundary days occur on a **Monday**.

On the sprint boundary day we will:

* Perform a milestone pre-release (when applicable).
* Have release related meetings, instead of any usually recurring meetings:
  * Grooming (30 minutes):
    * Making sure epics are on track.
    * Reviewing the Definition of Done for each epic.
    * Moving epics back to the Backlog, in case they're de-prioritized.
  * Retrospective (30 minutes):
    * Looking back at the task sizes and assessing if they were correct.
    * General process improvement.
  * Demos (30 minutes):
    * Any enhancements (or parts of) that have been delivered in the sprint.
    * Other interesting changes (e.g. refactors) that aren't part of any epic.
    * In case there's nothing to showcase, this meeting will be skipped.

Each release follows a fixed timeline, with 4 development sprints and one final sprint for stabilization.
The version will be released one week after the last sprint, and the planning work for the next release will begin.
