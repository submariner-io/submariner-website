The Submariner documentation website is based on Hugo, Grav,
[the Hugo Learn theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-learn/), and is written in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) format.

You can always click the **Edit this page** link at the top right of each page, but if you want to test your changes locally before
submitting you can:

1. Fork the [submariner-io/submariner-website](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-website/fork) on GitHub.
2. Check out your copy locally:

    ```bash
    git clone ssh://git@github.com/<your-user>/submariner-website.git
    cd submariner-website
    make server
    ```

3. An instance of the website is now running locally on your machine and is accessible at <http://localhost:1313>.

   {{% notice note %}}
By default, the server can only be accessed from the same machine it's run on.
Running `make server BIND=0.0.0.0 PORT=8080` will allow remote access via any IP address on the machine (remote or local) on port 8080.
Setting `BIND` to a specific IP address restricts access to that address alone.

4. Edit files in src. The browser should automatically reload so you can view your changes.
5. Eventually commit, push, and pull-request your changes. You can find a good guide about the GitHub workflow
   [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project).
6. Your changes will be verified by CI. Check the job results for details of any errors.
