This quickstart guide covers the necessary steps to deploy two OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)
clusters on GCP leveraging a cloud network load balancer service in front of the Submariner gateways.

The main benefit of this mode is that there is no need to dedicate specialized nodes with a public IP
address to act as gateways. The administrator only needs to manually label any existing
node or nodes in each cluster as Submariner gateways, and the submariner-operator will take care of creating a LoadBalancer
type Service pointing to the active Submariner gateway.

Please note that this mode is still experimental and may need more testing. For example we haven't
measured the impact on HA failover times.

### Install `subctl`

### Prepare GCP Clusters for Submariner

### Install Submariner with Service Discovery

To install Submariner with multi-cluster Service Discovery follow the steps below:

#### Use cluster-a as Broker

```bash
subctl deploy-broker --kubeconfig cluster-a/auth/kubeconfig
```

#### Join cluster-a and cluster-b to the Broker

```bash
subctl join --load-balancer --kubeconfig cluster-a/auth/kubeconfig broker-info.subm --clusterid cluster-a
```

```bash
subctl join --load-balancer  --kubeconfig cluster-b/auth/kubeconfig broker-info.subm --clusterid cluster-b
```
