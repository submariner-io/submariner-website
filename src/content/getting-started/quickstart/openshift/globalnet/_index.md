This quickstart guide covers the necessary steps to deploy two OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clusters on AWS with
full stack automation, also known as installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI). Once the OpenShift clusters are deployed, we deploy
Submariner to interconnect the two clusters. Since the two clusters share the same Cluster and Service CIDR ranges,
[Globalnet](../../../architecture/globalnet/) will be enabled.

### Create and Deploy cluster-a

In this step you will deploy **cluster-a** using the default IP CIDR ranges:

| Pod CIDR     | Service CIDR |
|--------------|--------------|
|10.128.0.0/14 |172.30.0.0/16 |

```bash
openshift-install create install-config --dir cluster-a
```

```bash
openshift-install create cluster --dir cluster-a
```

When the cluster deployment completes, directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to its web console and credentials for the
`kubeadmin` user, display in your terminal.

### Create and Deploy cluster-b

In this step you will deploy **cluster-b** using the same default IP CIDR ranges:

| Pod CIDR     | Service CIDR |
|--------------|--------------|
|10.128.0.0/14 |172.30.0.0/16 |

```bash
openshift-install create install-config --dir cluster-b
```

```bash
openshift-install create cluster --dir cluster-b
```

When the cluster deployment completes, directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to its web console and credentials for the
`kubeadmin` user, display in your terminal.

### Prepare AWS Clusters for Submariner

{{% cloud-prepare/aws clusters="cluster-a,cluster-b" %}}

### Install `subctl`

### Install Submariner with Service Discovery and Globalnet

To install Submariner with multi-cluster service discovery and support for overlapping CIDRs follow the steps below.

#### Use cluster-a as Broker with service discovery and globalnet enabled

```bash
subctl deploy-broker  --kubeconfig cluster-a/auth/kubeconfig --globalnet
```

#### Join cluster-a and cluster-b to the Broker

```bash
subctl join --kubeconfig cluster-a/auth/kubeconfig broker-info.subm --clusterid cluster-a
```

```bash
subctl join --kubeconfig cluster-b/auth/kubeconfig broker-info.subm --clusterid cluster-b
```
