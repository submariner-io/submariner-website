This section describes how to create a Submariner product release. It is assumed that you are familiar with the various
Submariner projects and their repositories and are familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Project dependencies

The Submariner projects have a dependency hierarchy with respect to their Go libraries and Docker images.
Therefore the releases for each individual project must be created in a specific order.

The Go dependency hierarchy flow is as follows:

`shipyard` <- `admiral` <- `[submariner, lighthouse]` <- `submariner-operator`

Note that the `submariner` and `lighthouse` projects are siblings and thus do not depend on one another. Also the
`submariner-operator` components expect that `lighthouse` and `submariner` are aligned on the same exact version.

The Docker image dependency hierarchy flow is as follows:

`subctl binary` <- `shipyard dapper base image` <- `[admiral, submariner, lighthouse, submariner-operator]`

The Dapper base image that is provided by `shipyard` for building and E2E tests in all of the other projects pulls in the
`subctl` binary.

## Release versions

The `vx.x.x` version format is used for the git projects while `x.x.x` is used for Docker images.

The typical workflow is to first create release candidate(s) for testing before creating the final release. The suggested
naming convention is to append `-rcN` to the final version, for example `v0.5.0-rc0`, `v0.5.0-rc1` etc.

Sometimes you may want to create a specific project release for testing prior to creating a release candidate. In this
case, the suggested naming convention is to append `-preN`.

## Create Submariner product release

The following sections outline the steps to be taken in order to create a full Submariner product release. As an example,
we'll use version `v0.5.0`.

Project releases can either be created via the git CLI or the GitHub UI. This guide uses the GitHub UI as it is
simpler. Here are general steps for creating a new release in a project:

1) Navigate to the project's main releases page.

2) Click `Draft a new release`

3) Fill in the `Tag version` field with the new version.

4) Fill in the `Release title` field as appropriate. Typically this is just the version (sans the leading `v`) as a release
   usually contains various changes. But if it's a targeted release then the `Release title` can reflect that.

5) Enter information to describe the release. This is optional for pre-releases but should be filled in for
   a final release.

6) If this is not a final release, mark the checkbox `This is a pre-release`. This includes release candidates. This is
   important so it is not labeled as the Latest release in GitHub.

7) Click `Publish release`.

For most projects a GitHub action job will be initiated to build release artifacts and publish to Quay. This will take
several minutes. You can monitor the progress from the project's main page. In the branches/tags pull-down above the
file listing heading, select the tag for the new version. A small yellow circle icon should be present to the right of the
file listing heading which indicates a job is in progress. You can click it to see details. There may be several checks
for the job listed but the important one is `Release Images`. When complete, the indicator icon will change to either a
green check mark on success or a red X on failure. A failure likely means the artifacts were not published to Quay, in
which case select the failed check, inspect the logs, correct the issue and re-run the job.

### Step 0: Create a `subctl` pre-release, optional

Since `subctl` is provided by `shipyard`'s Dapper base image, if there are specific changes to `subctl` which other
projects require, you will need to create a pre-release (for example `v0.5.0-pre0`) of the `submariner-operator` project:

1) Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/releases) page and create the release
   with the new version.

2) In the `shipyard` project, edit `package/Dockerfile.shipyard-dapper-base` and set `SUBCTL_VERSION` to the new version.

3) Commit the change and create a pull request with the `e2e-projects` label so it runs the E2E tests on the consuming projects. After the
   tests successfully complete, have it merged.

### Step 1: Create release for the `shipyard` project

Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/submariner-io/shipyard/releases) page and create the release with the new
version. This will initiate a job to build the Dapper base image. Once successfully completed, the generated image
version (`0.5.0`) should be available on Quay here:

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/shipyard-dapper-base?tab=tags>

### Step 2: Create release for the `admiral` project

1) Pin the `shipyard` Dapper base image to the new version. Edit `Dockerfile.dapper` and, on the first line, change
   the `shipyard-dapper-base` image version from `devel` to the new version (`0.5.0`).

2) Update the _go.mod_ and _go.sum_ references for `shipyard` to the new version:

   ```bash
   make shell
   go get github.com/submariner-io/shipyard@v0.5.0
   go mod vendor
   go mod tidy
   exit
   ```

3) Commit the changes, create a pull request, and have it merged.

4) Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/submariner-io/admiral/releases) and create the release for the new version.

### Step 3: Create releases for the `submariner` and `lighthouse` projects

These can be done in any order or in parallel and the process is the same.

1) Pin the `shipyard` Dapper base image to the new version. Edit `Dockerfile.dapper` and, on the first line, change
   the `shipyard-dapper-base` image version from `devel` to the new version (`0.5.0`).

2) Update the _go.mod_ and _go.sum_ references for the dependent projects to the new version:

   ```bash
   make shell
   go get github.com/submariner-io/shipyard@v0.5.0
   go get github.com/submariner-io/admiral@v0.5.0
   go mod vendor
   go mod tidy
   ```

3) Commit the changes, create a pull request, and have it merged.

4) Navigate to the project's releases page and create the release for the new version.

Wait for the project's new images to be generated and published to Quay.

For `submariner`:

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner?tab=tags>
> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner-route-agent?tab=tags>
> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner-globalnet?tab=tags>

For `lighthouse`:

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/lighthouse-agent?tab=tags>
> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/lighthouse-coredns?tab=tags>

### Step 4: Create release for the `submariner-operator` project

1) Pin the `shipyard` Dapper base image to the new version. Edit `Dockerfile.dapper` and, on the first line, change
   the `shipyard-dapper-base` image version from `devel` to the new version (`0.5.0`).

2) Update the _go.mod_ and _go.sum_ references for the dependent projects to the new version:

   ```bash
   make shell
   go get github.com/submariner-io/shipyard@v0.5.0
   go get github.com/submariner-io/submariner@v0.5.0
   go get github.com/submariner-io/lighthouse@v0.5.0
   go mod vendor
   go mod tidy
   ```

3) Edit _pkg/versions/versions.go_ and update the *Version constants to the new version:

   ```go
   DefaultSubmarinerOperatorVersion = "0.5.0"
   DefaultSubmarinerVersion         = "0.5.0"
   DefaultLighthouseVersion         = "0.5.0"
   ```

4) Commit the changes, create a pull request, and have it merged.

5) Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/releases) and create the release for the
   new version.

Once the image release job successfully completes, the generated image version (`0.5.0`) should be available on Quay here:

> <https://quay.io/repository/submariner/submariner-operator?tab=tags>

There is a separate job to publish the `subctl` binaries for the various platforms. These should be listed under the `Assets`
section for the new release on the main [releases](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/releases) page.
If not then the job failed so correct the issue and re-run the job.

Note that either job could fail while the other succeeds so it is important to verify both.

### Step 5: Update `subctl` version in `shipyard`

Update the Dapper base image to pull in the latest `subctl` binary:

1) In the `shipyard` project, edit `package/Dockerfile.shipyard-dapper-base` and set `SUBCTL_VERSION` to the new version.

2) Commit the change and create a pull request with the `e2e-projects` label so it runs the E2E tests on the consuming projects. After the
   tests successfully complete, have it merged.

### Step 6: Unpin the `shipyard` Dapper base image version

At this point the new product release has been successfully created however we don't want to leave each downstream
project pinned to the new `shipyard` Dapper base image version. For ongoing development we want each project to
automatically pick up the latest changes to the base image.

For each project, `admiral`, `lighthouse`, `submariner`, and `submariner-operator`:

1) Edit `Dockerfile.dapper` and, on the first line, change the `shipyard-dapper-base` image version back to `devel`.

2) Commit the changes, create a pull request, and have it merged.

### Step 7: Add release notes

If this is a final release, add a section for it on this website's [release notes](../../releases/) page.

1) Clone the [submariner-website](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-website) project.

2) Open `src/content/releases/_index.en.md` and make changes.

3) Commit the changes, create a pull request, and have it reviewed and merged.

Alternatively you can edit the file and create a pull request directly on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-website/edit/master/src/content/releases/_index.en.md)

### Step 8: Verify the release

You can follow any of the [quick start guides](../../quickstart).

### Step 9: Update the Submariner Operator on OperatorHub.io

The [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators) Git repository
is the source for sharing Kubernetes Operators with the broader community. This repository is split into two sections:

* Operators for deployment to a vanilla Kubernetes environment (upstream-community-operators).
These are shared with the Kubernetes community via [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/).
* Operators for deployment to OpenShift (community-operators)

To publish the Submariner Operator to the community, perform the following steps:

1) Clone the [submariner-operator](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator) project
2) Make sure you have operator-sdk v1 installed on your machine
   otherwise follow [this guide](https://v1-0-x.sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/install-operator-sdk/)
3) Generate new package manifests by running the command:

   ```bash
   make packagemanifests VERSION=${new_version} FROM_VERSION=${previous_version} CHANNEL=${channel}
   ```

   the generated package output should be located in `/packagemanifests/${VERSION}/`
4) Fork and clone [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators) project.
5) Update the Kubernetes Operator:
    * copy the generated package from step 3 into `upstream-community-operators/submariner`
    * copy the generated package definition `/packagemanifests/submariner.package.yaml`
    into `upstream-community-operators/submariner/`
    * test the Operator by running the command: `make operator.test OP_PATH=upstream-community-operators/submariner`
    * preview the Operator on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/preview)
    * once everything is fine, review this
    [checklist](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/blob/master/docs/pull_request_template.md)
    and create a new PR on [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators)
6) Update the OpenShift Operator:
   * re-run step 5 on the `community-operators/submariner` directory.
