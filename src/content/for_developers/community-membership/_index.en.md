**This is a stripped-down version of the [Kubernetes Community Membership
process][parent process].**

**Although we aspire to follow the Kubernetes process, some parts are not currently
relevant to our structure or possible with our tooling:**

* **The SIG and subproject abstraction layers don't apply to Submariner.
  Submariner is treated as a single project with file-based commit rights, not
  a "project" per repository.**
* **We hope to eventually move to Kubernetes OWNERS and Prow, but until we do so we
  can't support advanced role-based automation (reviewers vs approvers;
  PR workflow commands like /okay-to-test, /lgtm, /approved).**

This doc outlines the various responsibilities of contributor roles in
Submariner.

helped with PR workflow, and directed to relevant documentation and
communication channels.

We require every contributor to certify that they are legally permitted to contribute to our project.
A contributor expresses this by consciously signing their commits,
and by this act expressing that they comply with the [Developer Certificate Of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
