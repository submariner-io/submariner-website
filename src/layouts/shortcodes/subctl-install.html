Download the subctl binary and make it available on your PATH.

```bash
curl -Ls https://get.submariner.io | bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
echo export PATH=\$PATH:~/.local/bin >> ~/.profile
```

If you have Go installed, you can use that instead:

```bash
go install github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator/pkg/subctl
```

(and ensure your `go/bin` directory is on your `PATH`).
